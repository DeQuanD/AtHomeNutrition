# At Home Nutrition 

## User-story

As a dieter, I want to view nutritional information so that I can make informed eating decisions at home

### Description

At Home Nutrition is an application designed to aid the average food eater in determining the nutritional values inside the average product they might find inside their fridge or pantry. The application uses the api's from Spoonacular and Food-Data-Central. Spoonacular is used to pull down names of every day grocery items and render them to the page, where they are displayed as clickable buttons. Upon clicking, the buttons will call nutrient information from our second api Food-Data-Central then render them to the page. Using these two api's At Home Nutrition provides a simple to use application that allows users to see detailed nutrient information at the click of a button.
